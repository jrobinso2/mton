# Contributing to MTON
Because MTON is open source we rely on folks like you!  Our community is made up of passionate, committed developers and 3D artists.  If you'd like to contribute, take a look at our [roadmap](#roadmap) to see where we are and where we're headed.  
- [Status](#status): where we're at.
- [Goals](#goals): where we're headed.


## Developer Contributions
There are currently opportunities for developer contributions in the following areas:
- [MTON Definitions](./docs/definitions.md)
- [MTON Data Types](./docs/data.md)
- [MTON Namespaces](./docs/namespaces.md)
- [MTON Classes](./docs/classes.md)
- [MTON File Format Definition](./docs/file-format.md)
- [Exchange Plugins](./docs/plugins.md)

## Roadmap
### What We're Building
More details can be found in [Approach](./docs/approach.md).

Just to refresh, MaterialX Object Notation (MTON) is a simplified partial build of the [MaterialX](http://materialx.org) open standard for material exchange. MTON converts PBR portions of the MaterialX XML library to simplified key:value pairs in a JSON object structure.  

By simplifying how MaterialX data is encoded, we hope to simplify the creation of exchange plugins for popular rendering packages.

If you haven't familiarized yourself with the MaterialX project, head over to [their website](http://materialx.org) and take a look around and once you're done reading their documentation, head back here.

Okay.  Now that you understand Material X (I'm sure you read everything on their site, right?), let's take a look at our current status and goals:
